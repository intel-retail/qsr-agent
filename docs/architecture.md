# QSR Agent Architecture

[Repository overview](../README.md) | [Documentation guide](index.md) |
[Setup](setup.md) | **Architecture** |
[Add a service](adding-a-service.md)

The deployable unit is one edge-hosted agent plus independently owned domain
services. The agent runtime may later change from Hermes to another MCP-capable
framework without moving source data or business policy into the agent.

## Responsibility Boundaries

| Component | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| Agent runtime | Conversation, tool registration, skill loading, cross-domain orchestration | Restaurant source data or domain authorization |
| OVMS/Qwen | Reasoning, tool selection, answer synthesis | Tool execution or trusted state |
| MCP service | Domain reads, actions, validation, policy, audit data | Cross-domain conversation policy |
| Domain skill | Question routing, field interpretation, answer and action procedure | Live values, credentials, or enforceable authorization |
| `AGENTS.md` | Stable rules spanning every domain | Detailed per-service field mappings |

## Runtime Flow

```text
User
  -> Agent loads relevant domain skill
  -> Qwen selects a direct MCP tool
  -> Agent sends tools/call over local stdio or Streamable HTTP
  -> Domain service reads or acts through its policy gate
  -> Agent returns structured result to Qwen
  -> Qwen answers using only returned evidence
```

`tools.tool_search.enabled: off` is intentional while the catalog is small. It
gives Qwen the real MCP schemas directly and removes the deferred
`tool_search -> tool_describe -> tool_call` wrapper sequence.

## Remote Deployment

Use Streamable HTTP for services running on separate machines. The Dockerfile
under `tests/mcp-services/` demonstrates this topology with simulated data; it
does not run Hermes and is not a production service image. Production services
should use authoritative handlers and sit behind HTTPS plus bearer-token or
mTLS enforcement. Restrict ingress to the agent machine.

The selected agent runtime owns only endpoint configuration. For Hermes:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  service-name:
    url: https://service-name.example.internal/mcp
    transport: streamable-http
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${SERVICE_MCP_TOKEN}
    enabled: true
```

The platform scope separately controls availability in ordinary sessions:

```yaml
platform_toolsets:
  cli:
    - kiosk
    - order-accuracy
```

Do not configure both `url` and `command` for the same server. Keep the working
stdio registration until the corresponding remote endpoint passes the agent's
MCP connectivity test, then replace it atomically.

## Service Owner Contract

Every service owner supplies these artifacts:

1. A stable MCP server name and HTTPS endpoint.
2. One broad `get_<domain>_context` read tool for general and complex questions.
3. Narrow action tools with typed inputs and policy gates.
4. JSON Schemas with units, time windows, confidence semantics, stable IDs,
   `schema_version`, `source`, and `observed_at` where applicable.
5. One domain `SKILL.md` containing question-to-tool-to-field mappings.
6. Tests for context shape, action denial/approval, and transport startup.
7. Health, audit, and tool-call logs that exclude credentials.

The broad context response should be bounded and decision-ready. Split it into
narrow reads only when payload size, latency, authorization, or update cadence
requires different handling.

## Adding a Service

Follow [adding-a-service.md](adding-a-service.md) for the complete server,
client, Hermes registration, skill, optional `AGENTS.md`, and test procedure.

## Verification Ladder

1. Unit-test the service function and policy gate without a model.
2. Start the service with `QSR_MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http`.
3. Run `hermes mcp test <service>` from the Hermes machine.
4. Ask one simple and one complex domain question.
5. Confirm the service observed `tools/call` and the answer matches its result.
6. Test a denied action and an approved action separately.
7. Test a cross-domain question with one service intentionally unavailable;
   Hermes must report partial coverage instead of fabricating the missing data.
