# Get Started

This guide takes you from a fresh Intel® edge system to a running QSR Store
Agent.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux system with an Intel® GPU that meets the
  [System Requirements](get-started/system-requirements.md).
- Docker Engine with the Compose plugin, Git, `make`, and Python 3.
- Network access to GitHub, Docker Hub, and Hugging Face. Behind a proxy, see
  [Configuration](get-started/configuration.md#proxy).

## Step 1: Get the Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intel-retail/qsr-agent.git
cd qsr-agent
```

## Step 2: Download the Model

```bash
make download-models
```

This downloads the model set by `MODEL_ID` in `.env.example` (default
`OpenVINO/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-int4-ov`, about 16 GB) into `./models`. The download is skipped if the model is already present.

## Step 3: Connect the Kiosk and Order Accuracy Services

Kiosk and order-accuracy data come from the smart-kiosk-assistant and Order
Accuracy (take-away, dine-in) services on their own hosts. Set their URLs in
`.env.example` before you start the agent:

```bash
QSR_KIOSK_MCP_URL=http://<kiosk-host>:8014/mcp
QSR_ORDER_ACCURACY_TAKE_AWAY_MCP_URL=http://<take-away-host>:8010/mcp
QSR_ORDER_ACCURACY_DINE_IN_MCP_URL=http://<dine-in-host>:8011/mcp
QSR_EXTRA_NO_PROXY=<kiosk-host>,<take-away-host>
```

The service hosts also need settings so their events reach the agent, and all
hosts need synchronized clocks. See
[Run Kiosk and Order Accuracy on Remote Hosts](get-started/configuration.md#run-kiosk-and-order-accuracy-on-remote-hosts).
Without these URLs the agent runs with weather only.

## Step 4: Start the Agent

```bash
make up
```

`make up` checks Docker, the Intel GPU device, and the model. It then pulls the
agent image and starts four containers (to run the code you cloned instead of
the published image, use `make up REGISTRY=false`; see
[Build from Source](get-started/build-from-source.md)):

| Container | Role |
|---|---|
| `ovms` | OpenVINO™ Model Server running the language model on the Intel® GPU |
| `inference-router` | Inference Router that the agent runtime sends model requests to; forwards them to `ovms` |
| `qsr-agent` | Operator UI and agent runtime |
| `weather` | Weather service (simulated by default) |

The first start loads the model onto the GPU and warms it up. This can take a
few minutes. Check progress with:

```bash
make status
```

The agent is ready when `qsr-agent` reports `healthy`.

## Step 5: Open the Operator UI

Open `http://<host>:8600` in a browser, or `http://localhost:8600` on the same
machine.

Try a few questions in **Operator Chat**:

- *What is the current queue count?*
- *What is the current order accuracy rate?*
- *What's the weather at the store right now?*

## Step 6: Trigger an Event

Change the simulated weather. This also sends a weather event to the agent:

```bash
make weather CONDITION=rain TEMP=12
```

The event appears in the **Autonomy Decisions** panel, and the agent evaluates
it. If the agent proposes a change, such as taking cold drinks off the menu,
select **Approve** or **Reject**. See the [Operator Guide](operator-guide.md)
for more.

## Stop the Agent

```bash
make down
```

Settings, decisions, and learned behaviour are kept in Docker volumes and are
restored on the next `make up`.

## Next Steps

- Connect your store services: [Configuration](get-started/configuration.md).
- Understand the system: [How It Works](how-it-works.md).
- Build the images yourself: [Build from Source](get-started/build-from-source.md).
