# Configuration

## How Settings Are Applied

Edit `.env.example` in the repository root. Every `make up` copies it to `.env`,
so changes made directly to `.env` are overwritten.

| What you changed | Apply with |
|---|---|
| `.env.example` | `make up` |
| `agent-config/hermes/*.yaml` or `qsr-skills/` | `make restart` |

## Settings You Must Change

| Where | Setting | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Agent `.env.example` | `QSR_KIOSK_MCP_URL`, `QSR_ORDER_ACCURACY_TAKE_AWAY_MCP_URL`, `QSR_ORDER_ACCURACY_DINE_IN_MCP_URL` | Kiosk and order accuracy have no local substitute; empty means no kiosk or order-accuracy data |
| Agent `.env.example` | `QSR_EXTRA_NO_PROXY` (behind a proxy) | Lists the service hosts so the agent reaches them directly |
| Agent `.env.example` | `MODEL_ROOT`, `MODEL_ID` (if not the defaults) | Must point at a downloaded model, or `make up` stops |
| Kiosk host | `KIOSK_CORE_QSR_AUTONOMY_EVENTS_URL`, `KIOSK_CORE_QSR_AUTONOMY_STORE_ID`, `KIOSK_CORE_QSR_EXTRA_NO_PROXY` | Without them the kiosk sends no events, or they are rejected or sent to the proxy |
| Take-away and dine-in hosts | `MCP_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0`, `QSR_AUTONOMY_EVENTS_URL`, `QSR_AUTONOMY_STORE_ID`, `QSR_AUTONOMY_EVENT_TYPES`, agent host in `NO_PROXY` | The MCP port otherwise listens on loopback only, and events are not sent |
| Every host | NTP time synchronization | A clock two minutes off makes every decision for that host's events fail |

The store ID on every service must be `qsr-001`, the agent's store ID. Details
are in
[Run Kiosk and Order Accuracy on Remote Hosts](#run-kiosk-and-order-accuracy-on-remote-hosts).

## Main Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MODEL_ROOT` | `./models` | Host directory that holds downloaded models |
| `MODEL_ID` | `OpenVINO/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-int4-ov` | Model served by the OpenVINO™ Model Server. Use an OpenVINO™ model with tool-calling support, for example `OpenVINO/Qwen3-8B-int4-ov`. After changing it, run `make download-models` and `make up` |
| `QSR_UI_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Interface the operator UI listens on. Use `127.0.0.1` for local-only access |
| `QSR_UI_PORT` | `8600` | Operator UI port |
| `OVMS_PORT` | `4444` | Host port for the model server API (loopback only) |
| `WEATHER_PORT` | `8090` | Host port for the weather service (loopback only) |
| `HERMES_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Seconds to wait for one agent answer |
| `QSR_EXTRA_NO_PROXY` | empty | Comma-separated LAN hosts the agent must reach without the proxy |

## Image Source

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `REGISTRY` | `true` | `true` pulls the published image; `false` builds it locally |
| `REGISTRY_URL` | `intel/` | Registry and namespace prefix |
| `TAG` | `latest` | Image tag |

```bash
make up                                            # pull intel/qsr-agent:latest
make up REGISTRY_URL=myreg.io/team/ TAG=2026.2.0   # custom registry and tag
```

To build locally, see [Build from Source](build-from-source.md).

## Weather

By default the weather service is a simulator that you control with
`make weather`. To report live conditions for the store location instead, add
these lines to `.env.example`:

```bash
WEATHER_BACKEND=open-meteo
WEATHER_LATITUDE=12.97
WEATHER_LONGITUDE=77.59
WEATHER_LOCATION_NAME=My Restaurant
WEATHER_STORE_ID=qsr-001
```

Open-Meteo's free API is for non-commercial use. Commercial deployments need a
paid key or a self-hosted instance.

## Connect Store Services

Store systems connect to the agent as MCP services. They are listed in
`agent-config/hermes/remote-mcp.example.yaml`. Each entry needs a URL that the
agent container can reach:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  your-service:
    url: https://your-service.example.internal/mcp
    transport: streamable-http
    enabled: true
    connect_timeout: 15
    timeout: 120
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_SERVICE_MCP_TOKEN}
```

- **Same machine:** use `host.docker.internal` instead of `127.0.0.1`. Inside
  the container, `127.0.0.1` refers to the container itself.
- **Another machine:** use its IP address or DNS name. If a proxy is set, add
  the host to `QSR_EXTRA_NO_PROXY`.
- **Disable a service:** set `enabled: false`.

The preconfigured entries read their URLs from `.env.example`. Leave
`QSR_SAD_MCP_URL` or `QSR_LP_MCP_URL` empty to skip that service:

| Service | Purpose | Setting |
|---|---|---|
| `weather` | Store-location weather | `QSR_WEATHER_MCP_URL` |
| `suspicious-activity` | Kitchen food-safety events | `QSR_SAD_MCP_URL` |
| `loss-prevention` | Self-checkout loss events | `QSR_LP_MCP_URL` |
| `order-accuracy-take-away` | Take-away order accuracy | `QSR_ORDER_ACCURACY_TAKE_AWAY_MCP_URL` |
| `order-accuracy-dine-in` | Dine-in order accuracy | `QSR_ORDER_ACCURACY_DINE_IN_MCP_URL` |
| `kiosk` | Queue, menu, and kiosk settings | `QSR_KIOSK_MCP_URL` |
| `digital-signage` | In-store advertising | `QSR_DIGITAL_SIGNAGE_MCP_URL` |
| `store-activity-service` | Café-day orders, customers, and queue | `EDGEMART_SIM_MCP_URL` |
| `table-occupancy-service` | Table occupancy and cleaning | `EDGEMART_TABLE_SIM_MCP_URL` |
| `footfall-service` | Zone footfall and busy hours | `EDGEMART_FOOTFALL_SIM_MCP_URL` |

Services that are not running appear as unavailable in **Connected apps**. The
agent keeps working with the services it can reach.

After editing the file, run `make restart`. Self-signed HTTPS certificates on
service endpoints are trusted automatically each time the agent starts. If a
service regenerates its certificate, restart the agent.

## Send Events From Store Systems

Store systems send events to the agent with an HTTP `POST` to
`http://<agent-host>:8600/autonomy/events`. See the
[API Reference](../api-reference.md#post-autonomyevents) for the event format.

## Run Kiosk and Order Accuracy on Remote Hosts

The kiosk (smart-kiosk-assistant) and Order Accuracy (take-away, dine-in)
services provide the MCP tools the agent's built-in `kiosk` and `accuracy`
capabilities use (`get_kiosk_context`, `change_menu_items`,
`update_kiosk_settings`, `get_order_accuracy_context`, `request_remake`), and
push their events to the agent. There is no local substitute: without these
URLs the agent has no kiosk or order-accuracy data, and their skills, event
decisions and learning are not registered. With both take-away and dine-in
set, the agent merges their contexts and sends each remake to the venue that
flagged the order. Weather keeps running next to the agent.

### Step 1: Configure the Service Hosts

Set these variables in the shell (or the service's `.env`) on each host, then
start or restart the service with `docker compose up -d <service>`:

| Host | Service | Settings |
|---|---|---|
| Kiosk | `kiosk-core` | `KIOSK_CORE_QSR_AUTONOMY_EVENTS_URL=http://<agent-host>:8600/autonomy/events`, `KIOSK_CORE_QSR_AUTONOMY_STORE_ID=qsr-001`, `KIOSK_CORE_QSR_EXTRA_NO_PROXY=<agent-host>`. Optional: `KIOSK_CORE_QSR_AUTONOMY_EVENT_TYPES=queue_depth_sample`. MCP on port 8014 |
| Take-away | `order-accuracy` | `MCP_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0`, `QSR_AUTONOMY_EVENTS_URL=http://<agent-host>:8600/autonomy/events`, `QSR_AUTONOMY_STORE_ID=qsr-001`, `QSR_AUTONOMY_EVENT_TYPES=order_failed`, and `<agent-host>` in `NO_PROXY`. MCP on port 8010 |
| Dine-in | `dine-in`, `dinein-worker` | Same as take-away. MCP on port 8011 |

`QSR_AUTONOMY_STORE_ID` must be `qsr-001`, the agent's store ID, or the agent
rejects the events. The suggested event types keep the
agent from spending a model call on every validated order or on its own board
changes coming back as events. The kiosk polls its queue service every 30
seconds and sends a queue event when the queue depth (the median of the last
three polls) moves by 3 people or more, at most every 2 minutes, plus one
confirmation 5 minutes after each change. Tune these with the
`KIOSK_CORE_QSR_AUTONOMY_QUEUE_*` settings described in the kiosk's
`docs/qsr-mcp.md`.

### Step 2: Configure the Agent

In `.env.example`, set the service URLs and list the service hosts in
`QSR_EXTRA_NO_PROXY`, then run `make up`:

```bash
QSR_KIOSK_MCP_URL=http://<kiosk-host>:8014/mcp
QSR_ORDER_ACCURACY_TAKE_AWAY_MCP_URL=http://<take-away-host>:8010/mcp
QSR_ORDER_ACCURACY_DINE_IN_MCP_URL=http://<dine-in-host>:8011/mcp
QSR_EXTRA_NO_PROXY=<kiosk-host>,<take-away-host>
```

List the hosts by name or IP address. IP ranges such as `10.0.0.0/8` are not
honoured by every HTTP client.

### Step 3: Check the Connection

1. `curl -s http://localhost:8600/status?force=1` lists `kiosk`,
   `order-accuracy-take-away` and `order-accuracy-dine-in` with `"ok": true`.
   The kiosk offers 13 tools and each Order Accuracy service offers 6; fewer
   tools means the service runs an older version without
   `get_kiosk_context`/`get_order_accuracy_context`.
2. In **Operator Chat**, ask *"What is the kiosk queue?"* and *"What is the
   take-away rework rate?"*. The answers come from the remote services.
3. Send a test event from a service host. The event appears in **Autonomy
   Decisions** and `GET /autonomy/status`:

   ```bash
   # Kiosk host: a queue sample of 14 (the live queue must agree, or the agent takes no action)
   docker exec kiosk-core python3 -c '
   import time
   from kiosk_core.qsr_mcp import mcp_service as m
   m.init(); m.emit_queue_sample({"count": 14, "nearby": 5, "status": "HIGH"}); time.sleep(10)'

   # Take-away host: a failed order with one missing item
   docker exec -w /app oa_service python3 -c '
   import time
   from core import mcp_service as m
   m.emit_order_result({"order_id": "TEST-1", "station_id": "station_1", "run_number": 1, "status": "mismatch",
     "validation": {"missing": [{"name": "fries", "quantity": 1}], "extra": [], "quantity_mismatch": []}})
   time.sleep(10)'

   # Dine-in host: a failed plate with one missing item
   docker exec -w /app/src dinein_app python3 -c '
   import time
   import mcp_service as m
   m.emit_order_result({"order_id": "TEST-2", "station": "table_4", "image_id": "TEST-2-img",
     "order_complete": False, "accuracy_score": 0.6, "missing_items": [{"name": "naan", "quantity": 1}],
     "extra_items": [], "quantity_mismatches": []})
   time.sleep(10)'
   ```

   `oa_service`, `dinein_app` and `kiosk-core` are the container names the
   services' compose files set. Each event is written to the service's own log
   and sent to the agent like a real one.

### Operating Notes

- **Restarts:** start the services first, then the agent. After restarting
  a service, run `make restart` so the agent reconnects.
- **Clocks:** keep the agent and service hosts synchronized (NTP). The agent
  refuses to act on a service snapshot more than 120 seconds old, so a host
  whose clock is two minutes behind makes every decision for its events fail
  with a clock-skew error.
- **Security:** `/autonomy/events` and the Order Accuracy MCP ports have no
  authentication, and the token services send with events is not checked.
  Keep them on the store network or behind an authenticating proxy.

## Proxy

Export proxy variables in the shell before `make up`. They are passed to image
builds and containers:

```bash
export http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
export https_proxy=$http_proxy
export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,::1
```

If your proxy intercepts TLS, configure the system or Docker daemon to trust
the organization's CA. Do not disable TLS verification.

## Secure Network Access

The operator UI has no built-in login. Anyone who can reach port 8600 can chat
with the agent and approve actions. For any deployment beyond a lab:

- Set `QSR_UI_HOST=127.0.0.1` and reach the UI through an SSH tunnel or an
  authenticating reverse proxy:

  ```bash
  ssh -L 8600:127.0.0.1:8600 user@agent-host
  ```

- Restrict port 8600 to the store network and the systems that send events.
- Use HTTPS and authentication (a bearer token or mTLS) on every remote store
  service.
