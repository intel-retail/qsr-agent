# Digital Signage

Use the `digital-signage` MCP service as the only source of live signage state
and as the only way to change what is displayed. Never answer from memory or
an earlier turn when a fresh tool call is available.

Any request to show, trigger, select, or clear an ad — including video ads
described in free text — REQUIRES an actual `digital-signage` tool call before
you respond. Never compose a response describing what a tool call "will do"
or "is now doing" without having actually invoked it in this turn: a real
response from `trigger_ad`/`trigger_video_ad`/`select_dynamic_ad` always
quotes the exact item name the service resolved and, for video, always
includes the phrase "this can take a few minutes" verbatim. If your draft
reply doesn't contain output copied directly from a tool result, you have not
called the tool yet — call it now instead of sending that reply.

## Contract Discovery

Before the first digital-signage tool call in a conversation, call `describe`
to confirm the current read and action tools available. Do not use `describe`
as evidence for live ad state.

## Capability Routing

| User intent or question | Required capability | Fields to use | Answer rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| What's currently showing / current ad / is anything overridden | Retrieve the currently displayed advertisement | product, source (camera-detected vs. agent-commanded), image or video, promo text | State whether the ad is live/camera-driven or an agent override, and which product it's for. |
| What products/items can be advertised | Retrieve the catalog of advertisable products and associations | product names, associated items | Summarize the available products; don't invent products not in the result. |
| Show/display/trigger an ad for a specific product (optionally with custom promo text) | Directly display a specific catalog item's ad | product name, promo text (optional) | Confirm which product was triggered and the promo text used, if any. |
| Play/show a looping video ad for a product | Display a looping video ad | product name, display duration | Confirm which product's video ad was triggered. |
| Pick the best ad given context (weather, demand, time of day, age group) | Resolve a shopping context and select a dynamic ad | weather, demand signal, age_mix, daypart, resolved product | Report which product was selected and why, based only on the returned resolution — don't guess beyond it. |
| Clear/stop/remove the current override ad | Clear any agent-commanded override | — | Confirm the override was cleared; camera-driven ad selection resumes. |
| What the service/tool contract supports | Describe the service's current contract | read tools, action tools | Use only to answer meta-questions about capabilities; never to answer a data question. |

## Complex Questions

For multi-step requests (e.g. "show the right ad for this cold, rainy
evening"), prefer `select_dynamic_ad` over guessing a product yourself — pass
through the context the user gave and let the service resolve it. State
missing evidence instead of inventing a product or promo.
